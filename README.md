# 114th-Senate
Based on votes of U.S. Senators in the 114th Senate (in session from January 2015 to January 2017), this repository contains several Jupyter notebooks containing a series of (supervised and unsupervised) machine learning techniques to predict each Senator's party on the basis of their votes and a few other personal characteristics (age, gender, whether the member represents an urban or rural state, whether or not the member was born in the state in which he/she represents).  The urban/rural split is determined based on data from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization_in_the_United_States#Historical_statistics, where the urban states are taken as the top 25 states by percentage of the population that lives in an urban area based on the 2010 U.S. Census.



## Data source
